<h1> Who I Am</h1>

<body>
<p>
I'm Kameron Maziel and I look to be a pro web developer one day. I'd love to get my foot in the door and make sites for people all over the world. One of my biggest goals for this career is to defintely get picked up by Apple, Google, or Microsoft. I'd love to work with other companies as well but these 3 would be very ideal some day. I'm very disciplined and am willing to dedicate the time needed to learn and understand code! On my Free time I love to watch sports, mainly basketball on <a href="http://www.nba.com">NBA.com.</a> Hopefully the mavs can bring us another ring this year!
</p>
<p>Another one of my career goals would be to for sure learn react native. Learning not only how to make sites but things for mobile as well would be huge to me. I feel like since I would love to build my own personal brand this would be a beautiful skill to learn and turn many heads. My dream site would be something dealing with the creativity of Adult Swim. I think that company has great creative minds and I couldn't think of a better place to combine wacky ideas with sharp code. I mean maybe MTV but unfortunately it's no longer the 2000's.</p>

<p>Overall, as a student I really want to understand python, the basics of html, css, etc and master them. I know this sounds a bit crazy but I would seriously love to figure all these softwares out and have fun with it all. This requires a ton of work and can be a bit tricky but I believe with a healthy mindset and a healthy pace nothing should hold me back.I will also attend some conferences soon about web dev and computer science in Downtown next month. So I'm super excited to meet people in the same work space and share the same goals as me. Others may find coding tedious, but I find it really fun and enjoyable especially once the hard parts are out the way. This will be a great year and I look forward to this class!</p>
